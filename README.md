# Valip

Valip is a validation library for Clojure(Script). It is primarily
designed to validate keyword-string maps, such as one might get from a
HTML form.

This is an experimental fork of
[Chas Emerick](https://github.com/cemerick)'[valip](https://github.com/cemerick/valip)'
library that, in tunr, is a fork of
[James Reeves](http://github.com/weavejester)'
[valip](http://github.com/weavejester/valip) library. The differences
between this and that are significant:

1. I tried to make this fork compliant with the new Reader Conditional
   extension that was not available a the time Chas Emerick wrote its
   fork;.
2. Since I was breaking stuff anyway, I fixed a security issue and
   added the coverage of corner cases, hopefully all for the better.

# Installation

Add the following dependency to your `project.clj` file or to your
`build.boot` file:

    [org.clojars.magomimmo/valip "0.4.0-SNAPSHOT"]

# Usage

The main validation function is `valip.core/validate`. It uses the
following syntax:

    (validate map-of-values
      [key1 predicate1 error1]
      [key2 predicate2 error2]
      ...
      [keyn predicaten errorn])

For each vector, the key is used to look up a value in the map. The map value
is then tested with the predicate function. If the predicate fails, the error
message is included in the map of errors returned by the `validate` function. A
key may be tested multiple times with different predicates and errors.

If no predicate fails, `nil` is returned. If at least one predicate fails, a
map of keys to errors is returned:

    {key1 [error1]
     key2 [error2]
     ...
     keyn [errorn]}

The errors are listed in a vector, because there may be multiple errors for the
same key.

For example:

    (use 'valip.core 'valip.predicates)

    (def user
      {:name "Alice", :age 7})

    (validate user
      [:name present? "must be present"]
      [:age present? "must be present"]
      [:age (over 18) "must be over 18"])

    => {:age ["must be over 18"])

You can see an example of usage of the `valip` library in the
[`modern-cljs](https://github.com/magomimmo/modern-cljs) series of
tutorial on Clojure(Script).

# Predicates

Valip has a number of useful predicates and functions that generate
predicates.  More of these useful predicates will be eventually added
as the library matures.

You can find predicates in the `valip.predicates` namespace which
includes platform-specific predicates using the `#?` reader macro.
